## What is it?

Its about a project of the course Principles of Operating Systems (IC6600) in Technological Institute of Costa Rica that wants to develop a web-server aplication to emulate a File System.

The purpose of this project is to implement a Web drive for files. The intention is to put into practice knowledge about File Systems. For this, the functions of the File System that are broken down later will be implemented. It is a Web application where users can request a space for file storage. All the information management of the files is achieved from a .json file.
